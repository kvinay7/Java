# Java

Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented, high-level programming language developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990's. The main goal of creating Java was to achieve platform-independent, simple, and secure features.
- Platform Independent: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on the JVM. This abstraction allows the same bytecode to execute on any platform that has a compatible JVM, achieving true platform independence.
