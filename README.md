# Java

Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented, high-level programming language developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990's. The main goal of creating Java was to achieve platform-independent, simple, and secure features.
### Features
- ***Simplicity:*** Java's syntax is designed to be easy to learn, write and maintain code.
- ***Platform Independent:*** Java code is compiled into bytecode (platform-independent code), which runs on the JVM. This abstraction allows the same bytecode to execute on any platform that has a compatible JVM, achieving true platform independence.
- ***Portability:*** "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) emphasizes its design for cross-platform compatability and architecture-neutral.
- ***Security:*** Java provides robust security features like bytecode verification, a security manager, and sandboxing to protect against security threats.
- ***High Performance:*** Java uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to optimize performance by compiling bytecode to machine code at runtime.
- ***Dynamic Linking:*** Classes are linked at runtime rather than at compile time. This allows Java programs to load classes dynamically, ensuring better flexibility and scalability.
- ***Robustness:*** Java's strong memory management, type checking, and exception handling make it a reliable language for building robust applications.

### Terminologies
- ***JDK:*** Java Development Kit is need to compile java source code into bytecode and contains JRE & develop, debug, deploy tools.
- ***JRE:*** Java Runtime Environment is need to run a java program and contains JVM & libraries.
- ***JVM:*** Java Virtual Machine interprets the java bytecode to machine code and contains class loader (dynamic linking), bytecode verifier, JIT compiler.
- ***IDE:*** Integrated Development Environment makes writing code, compiling, executing, debbuging and test Easy!

### Identifier
An identifier is the name used to identify a variable & method (CamelCase), class & interface (PascalCase), constants (UPPER_CASE, UC) or any other user-defined item in the program.
- The first character must be a letter (A-Z or a-z), a dollar sign $, or an underscore _. It cannot be a digit (0-9).
- Identifiers are case-sensitive and cannot be the keywords or literals.

### Variables and Data Types
A variable is a container for storing data values and Data types define the type of data that can be stored in a variable.
