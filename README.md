# Java

Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented, high-level programming language developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990's. The main goal of creating Java was to achieve platform-independent, simple, and secure features.
- ***Platform Independent***: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on the JVM. This abstraction allows the same bytecode to execute on any platform that has a compatible JVM, achieving true platform independence.
- ***Portability***: "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) emphasizes its design for cross-platform compatability and architecture-neutral.
- ***Security***: Java provides robust security features like bytecode verification, a security manager, and sandboxing to protect against security threats.
- ***High Performance***: Java uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to optimize performance by compiling bytecode to machine code at runtime.
- ***Robustness***: Java's strong memory management, type checking, and exception handling make it a reliable language for building robust applications.
- ***Dynamic Linking***: Classes are linked at runtime rather than at compile time. This allows Java programs to load classes dynamically, ensuring better flexibility and scalability.
